# Automated-Chicken-Coop-wifi-enabled
This is the code and wiring diagram for an Automated Chicken Coop that is wifi enabled.

This is my first (and likely only) GitHub post, as I am only a mechanical engineer that loves
chickens and random projects like this. I'd like to share this with all of you out there looking
to create your own automated chicken coop.

**~ Features of this Automated Coop Include: ~**
- 2 Coop Doors (a coop door and a run door), powered by 12V DC electric motors that will 
  automatically open and close at user-specified times of day. 
- An automatic chicken feeder that activates at a user-specified time of day (once per day)
  and for a user-specified duration depending on how much feed is desired.
- 2 Thermocouples to monitor the temperature of the coop and (if desired) chicks. 
- A smartphone user-interface using the "Blynk App" to control and monitor all coop functions. 

**~ Components needed for Automation: ~**
- (1) Songhe Mega 2560 + WiFi (Arduino Mega w/ ESP8266 built-in)
- (2) L298N H-Bridge Motor Driver
- (4) RC-33 Reed Switches 
- (2) DS18B20 Thermocouples
- (1) 12V Power Supply
- (3) ~30rpm DC Electric Motors 
- (1) 4.7kohm resistor
- (4) 10kohm resistor
- (-) Necessary Wiring
- (1) Smartphone with "Blynk" App installed
